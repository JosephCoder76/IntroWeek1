// Predict -> Observe -> Explain

// It is essential for you to start working out what the code will do before it is executed by the computer. 
//In the snippet below try to work out what will be printed to the console and then execute the file with Node to see if 
//you were right :)

//Here we dont employ the return key word so the function will not return anything, so we will get undefined.

function double(num) {
  num * 2;
}

const result1 = double(10);
console.log(result1);
