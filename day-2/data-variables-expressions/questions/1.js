// Predict -> Observe -> Explain

// It is great practice for you to start working out what code will do before it is even executed by the computer.

// In the snippet below try to work out what will be printed to the console and then execute the file with Node to see if you were right :)
//We will get a debug arrer as the variable passed as a parameter to the console.log is not defined, nam is not name.
const name = "Anat";
console.log(nam);
