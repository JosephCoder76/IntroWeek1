// Predict -> Observe -> Explain

//Console log will return undefined as the name variable has not been assigned a value it has simply been setup as a variable with no value assigned.


// It is great practice for you to start working out what code will do before it is even executed by the computer.

//The second console log will output the "Paul" string as we have assigned the "Paul" value to the already declared name variable

//So we should get a line stating undefined and another one stating Paul

// In the snippet below try to work out what will be printed to the console and then execute the file with Node to see if you were right :)

let name;
console.log(name);

name = "Paul";
console.log(name);

// jot your thoughts down here...
