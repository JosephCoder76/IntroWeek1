//I used a for loop rather than repeating the console.log command 30 times, as I felt this was a more efficient way of doing so.

for (let i = 0;i <= 30 ; i++){

    console.log("*".repeat(20));
      }


// Print a 20 x 30 rectangle - the rectangle should be filled with *s

// You should only need to use .repeat() and console.log() for this task :)
